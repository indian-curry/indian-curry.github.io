Functional programming has been around since the beginning of computer
science. Despite its immense advantages, it has remained largely
obscure and relegated to a small community. Recently, functional
programming is seeing a new renaissance.  The academic community is
seeing an explosion of activities, and many more commercial
organisations are embracing the functional programming paradigm.

We are a group of functional programming enthusiasts who believe that
functional programming holds a lot of potential for Indian institutions
and that there is need for a more concerted effort to promote functional
programming in both the industry and the academic institutions of India.

Our aim is to:

1. Improve the collaboration between the various functional programming
   communities in India.

2. Encourage the adoption of functional programming and related formal
   techniques in the Indian industry.

3. Build a functional programming eco-system within the country by
   enabling closer cooperation between the industry and academia.

We encourage others to join us in our pursuit of these goals.
