Functional programming has been around since the beginning of computer
science. Despite its advantages, it had remained largely obscure and
relegated to a small community of hackers and academics. Recently,
functional programming is seeing a renaissance. Industrial grade
compilers, high quality libraries, and unique applications written in
these languages are driving their adoptation in commercial settings.

We are a group of functional programming enthusiasts who believe that
functional programming holds a lot of potential for Indian academic
institutions and software industry. There is a need for a more
concerted effort to promote functional programming in both the
industry and the academic institutions of India.

Our aim is to:

1. Improve collaboration between the various functional programming
   communities in India.

2. Encourage the adoption of functional programming and related formal
   techniques in the Indian industry.

3. Build a functional programming eco-system within the country by
   enabling closer cooperation between the industry and academia.

We encourage others to join us in our pursuit of these goals.
